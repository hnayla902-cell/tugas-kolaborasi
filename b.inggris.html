    <h2>LHo Observation Text: Bottle Cap Waste</h2>
     <p>Waste is the residual product of an activity or production process, whether from human activity, industry, or nature, that is no longer used. Waste can pollute the environment if not managed properly. In this observation, I will explain plastic bottle cap waste. One way to manage waste is by using the 3R principle: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.
     </p>
    <p> Plastic bottle caps are a type of waste that is easily found, especially in public places. Plastic bottle caps are very light and small, and are generally round. Bottle caps are usually used for bottled drinks such as Aqua, Le Mineral, Cleo, etc.
    </p>
    <p> Plastic bottle caps come in various colors, and the color of the board cap usually matches the color of the packaging. For example, Aqua bottle caps are dark blue, Le Mineral bottle caps are light blue, etc. Plastic bottle caps are made of polypropylene (PP), a type of plastic that is strong and resistant to liquids.
    </p>
    <p>Managing plastic bottles can benefit all living things. Reducing plastic waste can help reduce the amount of plastic waste polluting the environment. One way to recycle used plastic bottle caps is to make bags that can be used as shopping bags. This process can also transform valuable items into useful items.

<h2>Bottle Cap Waste</h2>
<p>Waste is the leftover or discarded material produced from human activities or production processes that is no longer wanted. There are three types of waste based on their form: solid waste, liquid waste, and gas waste. This time, I will explain in this observation about used bottle caps. Used bottle caps are leftover plastic or metal materials that are no longer used, from beverage bottles or other containers, which are included in (inorganic) waste and require special management because they do not decompose easily in nature. Waste management is very important so that plastic waste does not cause pollution.
</p>
<p>Bottle cap waste is the result of unwanted used bottles, which can be recycled to make crafts such as bags, flower vases, and others. Some people make use of plastic bottle caps as handicrafts and sell them again. Plastic waste comes from various types of waste that can last a long time.
The accumulation of unused or poorly managed waste can cause environmental pollution. Pollution such as water, soil, and others—piles of plastic waste also block drainage channels and can trigger flooding.

<h2>Writing an observation text: bottle cap waste</h2>
<p>Waste is leftover material or discarded items produced from a certain production process. In this observation, I will explain about bottle cap waste. Bottle cap waste is trash that comes from bottle caps made of plastic (usually HDPE) weighing around 16 grams.
</p>
<p>The body of the bottle cap is the main part, shaped flat and round, usually made of plastics such as polypropylene (polyethylene) or metal (aluminum).
The inner thread is the part inside the cap that has a spiral (circular ridged) shape, functioning to lock onto the thread on the bottle neck.
The sealing layer (seal) is usually a thin layer of plastic or rubber on the inside, functioning to keep the bottle air-tight so the contents stay fresh.
</p>
<p>The safety ring (ring seal) is the lower part of the plastic bottle cap that attaches to the bottle neck.
The leftover fragments are small pieces from the ring or thread that often scatter when the cap is opened.
Bottle caps can be made into bags to help reduce the amount of plastic waste. Besides that, they can promote a recycling lifestyle. By making bags from bottle caps, we not only help protect the environment but also create products that are functional and aesthetic. This can be done by arranging bottle caps of various colors and sizes and adding tape as the handle.
